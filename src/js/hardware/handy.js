// The Handy Wi-Fi driver (REST API v2, HAMP mode).
//
// Design rules, in priority order:
//   1. Fail safe: any doubt about the device state ends in a verified stop.
//      A stop is retried with backoff until the API confirms it; a device
//      that went offline keeps being sent stops in the background until one
//      is confirmed; a start that may have reached the device after a stop
//      is followed by another stop; the key the start was issued with is the
//      key that stop uses, so Disconnect or a reconnect can never orphan a
//      moving device.
//   2. Never exceed the user's hardware envelope; the stroke range sent to
//      PUT /slide is always normalised through handy-protocol.js, and the
//      range is confirmed by the API before the motor is started.
//   3. Stay under the API rate limit: velocity is throttled to one call per
//      400 ms and the slide range to one call per second unless it changed.
//
// All fetch calls go through handyRequest(), which classifies the reply and
// reports failures through the error handler installed by app.js.
